/// Appends frames to the log and makes them durable in groups.
///
/// Commits queue their frames in order, holding the store's publishing role. One flush task at a time, on the store's
/// [com.github.auties00.ledger.IoPool], takes everything queued, seals the frames, writes them with one call, forces
/// the segment once and wakes the commits waiting for any of them: commits that arrive while a force runs make the
/// next group, so concurrent commits share forces. Each group is padded with zeros to a multiple of [#ALIGNMENT], where
/// the next one starts, so the pages of acknowledged frames are never written again.
///
/// Segments come from [LogFiles] prepared: once a segment takes its first group, the next one is prepared on a thread
/// of its own, so a rollover only forces the full segment and switches to the next, and no file is created or renamed
/// on the way to a force. The first one is prepared the same way while the store opens, and the first group waits for
/// it: forcing a new file and its directory took most of an open on Windows and macOS. A prepared file may hold the
/// frames of an earlier use, which every frame header tells apart by the tag of its segment's salt.
///
/// A close keeps the segment prepared after the current one, cut to its first two blocks, and the next open writes
/// into it, as it does into any segment recovery finds prepared and never written: the first durable commit after an
/// open then waits for one force, where preparing a segment cost two more before it.
///
/// A new file is written with zeros first only while the commits wait for the forces and the log fills slower than
/// [#ZEROED_RATE]: the zeros halve the time of a force on Linux, but double the bytes the device takes, which slowed an
/// ingest of a history, whose commits do not wait, and 256 committers writing 100 MB a second, by a fifth.
///
/// A segment is a file of [#SEGMENT_HEADER] bytes of header followed by frames. Each use of it, the writing of one
/// open, draws a random tag, and the key of the use derives from the segment's number, a random salt of its own and
/// that tag: the offset of a frame is a unique nonce under its key, even where an open writes into a segment that an
/// earlier one began to write and crashed before any of it was durable, whose bytes a copy-on-write file system may
/// keep, and even if a segment number were ever used twice. A use writes past its first group only once a force made
/// that group durable, after which no open writes into the segment again, so at most one use of a segment has frames
/// past its first group:
///
/// ```text
/// segment header   0  "LGSEGMNT"

/// ```
///
/// The commit frames of a group whose sequences follow on and whose bodies hold at most [#RUN_MAX_BODY] bytes are
