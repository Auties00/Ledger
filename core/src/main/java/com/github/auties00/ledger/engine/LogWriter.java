/// Appends frames to the log and makes them durable in groups.
///
/// Commits queue their frames in order, holding the store's publishing role. One flush task at a time, on the store's
/// [com.github.auties00.ledger.IoPool], takes everything queued, seals the frames, writes them with one call, forces
/// the segment once and wakes the commits waiting for any of them: commits that arrive while a force runs make the
/// next group, so concurrent commits share forces. Each group is padded with zeros to a multiple of [#ALIGNMENT], where
/// the next one starts, so the pages of acknowledged frames are never written again.
///
/// Segments come from [LogFiles] prepared: once a segment takes its first group, the next one is prepared on a thread
/// of its own, so a rollover only forces the full segment and switches to the next, and no file is created or renamed
/// on the way to a force. The first one is prepared the same way while the store opens, and the first group waits for
/// it: forcing a new file and its directory took most of an open on Windows and macOS. A prepared file may hold the
/// frames of an earlier use, which every frame header tells apart by the tag of its segment's salt.
///
/// A close keeps the segment prepared after the current one, cut to its first two blocks, and the next open writes
/// into it, as it does into any segment recovery finds prepared and never written: the first durable commit after an
/// open then waits for one round trip to the device or one force, where preparing a segment cost two more before it.
/// The close marks the segment ([#KEPT_MARK]) as one whose name a force made durable, so a clean open forces nothing
/// for it; an open that finds a segment no close marked forces its name before a commit depends on it.
///
/// A new file is written with zeros first only while the commits wait for the forces and the log fills slower than
/// [#ZEROED_RATE], or has not filled a segment since the store opened but commits have waited for [#ZEROS_AFTER] groups:
/// the zeros halve the time of a force on Linux, but double the bytes the device takes, which slowed an ingest of a
/// history, whose commits do not wait, and 256 committers writing 100 MB a second, by a fifth. On Windows, where they
/// spare a force nothing, only while the log writes groups through as well ([LogFiles#zeroFills(boolean)]).
///
/// Where [WriteThrough] can, a group that one write holds and that lands below the bytes its segment already has is
/// written through to stable storage instead, durable once the write returns, and not forced: one round trip to the
/// device where a write and a force take two. The segment is opened a second time for it. A group of several writes,
/// one that rolls over, or one that would grow the file is written into the cache and forced as before, so an ingest
/// keeps the bandwidth of the cache, and a file system that refuses the writes through moves the writer to forces.
///
/// A store just opened has such bytes only in the first block of its first segment, which its first group takes when
/// one block holds it. The next segment is prepared without zeros, and written with them on a thread of its own once
/// commits have waited for [#ZEROS_AFTER] groups: on Windows a force beside the zeros takes several times as long,
/// which the few commits of a store that opens, writes and closes would pay and never gain from. The log moves to it between two groups as soon as it is ready, leaving the rest of the segment it was writing
/// unused; until then each group is forced. So a run of commits reaches the path within the time of one preparation,
/// whatever the size of a segment.
///
/// A segment is a file of [#SEGMENT_HEADER] bytes of header followed by frames. Each use of it, the writing of one
/// open, draws a random tag, and the key of the use derives from the segment's number, a random salt of its own and
/// that tag: the offset of a frame is a unique nonce under its key, even where an open writes into a segment that an
/// earlier one began to write and crashed before any of it was durable, whose bytes a copy-on-write file system may
/// keep, and even if a segment number were ever used twice. A use writes past its first group only once a force made
/// that group durable, after which no open writes into the segment again, so at most one use of a segment has frames
/// past its first group:
///
/// ```text
/// segment header   0  "LGSEGMNT"

/// ```
///
/// The commit frames of a group whose sequences follow on and whose bodies hold at most [#RUN_MAX_BODY] bytes are
